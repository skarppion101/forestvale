  "faq5": "What is my yield?",
  "faq5Desc": "The yield is up to ∞% daily. The reason why it's \"up to\" is because it fluctuates based on how often you sell, compound as well as total value locked.",

  "faq8": "What is the price of Evergreen?",

  "faq9Desc": "You will earn up to 5% of the ELF current value per day, this figure can be changed with using your Recollect strategy.",
  "faq10": "Why is my daily income dropping?",
  "faq10Desc": "Your strategy affects your profitability. If you sell Evergreen frequently, your rewards will drop. Also you pay 5% tax in each withdrawal from your ELF. Use Recollect feature to increase your income.",
  "faq11": "Can I use Recollect multiple times a day to increase my income?",
  "faq11Desc": "Yes, it will also increase your profitability, but don't forget that you have to pay a commission to Binance Smart C hain for each transaction.",
  "faq12": "Can I restore the Bust that ELFwere purchased with?",
  "faq12Desc": "Age of Mining is a blocked bounty pool, so you can't sell ELF, you can only sell Evergreen that your ELF are collecting.",

  "faq15Desc": "Yes, just like ASICs for Bitcoin 5% of available ELF are reborn when Evergreen is sold. They cannot be repaired, but you can buy new ELF using the Recollect feature. Keep this in mind when developing your own strategy.",
  "faq16": "Can developers make changes to the smart contract?",
  "faq16Desc": "No, once the contract has been deployed in the Binance Smart Chain network, no one can affect it, delete or change the code. Also our smart contract is reliable, you can read its audit from a third-party company. This is published on the main page of the site.",
  "faq17": "How can I get 10 Busd ELF as a gift?",
  "faq17Desc": "Any user can get ELF worth 10 Bust as a gift from AOMF. But you can't sell Evergreen or use the Recollect feature unless you have a minimum purchase of 50 Busd worth of ELF. This is a protection against abusers, we have to protect our smart contract so that all user are safe.",
  "faq18": "If I don't have enough minimum amount of purchased ELF to receive rewards from line 4 of the Expand Program , will I lose referral rewards?",
  "faq18Desc": "Yes, if your volume of summoned ELF is not enough to receive the reward, you will lose. It is recommended to reach the required volume of summon in time.",
  "faq19": "A new user has appeared in line 4 of my community, but I have not received reward, why?",
  "faq19Desc": "Check that the amount of your purchases matches the table. You do not have to make a one-time summon ELF, the amount of summon will also be taken into account.",
